    sakana "Given that this project is an unlicensed fan game based on the intellectual property of phase connect llc. we don't necessarily have any copyright to what we are making anyway. "

    sakana "hence why the actor mission framework this game is based on is a wholly separate project licensed under the MIT license."

    sakana "Coders it's recommended that you do the same for whatever unique mechanics you want to develop, or contribute to the actor mission framework directly "

    sakana "we will go over the acceptable content and the forking of this project to form your own version."

    sakana "As the main fork of this project. We as the main development team have an obligation to set a good example and run and moderate this project as well as reasonably possible. "

    sakana  "It is for that reason we will have these rules set out from the beginning for contributing to the project. "

    sakana  "Naturally this means we will have to be selective about what we accept into the project. "

    sakana "This however does not mean that we will attempt to or even have the ability to stop any forks or overhauls of this project by other 3rd party sources. "
    
    sakana "This is an open source project and as such we encourage any and all who want to make their own fork of this project or update their version with code from this project. "

    sakana "rules for contributing code and other in game assets"

    sakana "If you wish to contribute code, modules, assets, or music which you do not own. you absolutely have to make sure that 1 the asset is under an MIT, creative commons license or equivalent. 2 if not under the previous that the rights holder is aware of its intended use and the fact that it will be redistributed for free. 3 that the original source of the code, asset, or music is placed in the proper credits section. "
    show sakana tutorial closeup handonchest
    sakana "you can not contribute code, assets, or music if they do not fit those criteria. even if the original assets were paid for. "

    sakana "especially if the original assets were paid for. Most commercial licenses do not allow for the redistribution of the paid for intellectual property in an open source format."

    sakana "if the code or assets you provided do not fit those criteria. unfortunately they will not be allowed to be contributed or they will be removed if they had been previously contributed."

    sakana "lastly, no ai generated assets are allowed to be contributed to the project. use the generic assets provided to you if you can't draw. "

    sakana "we don't want to cause drama between the contributors and using AI art offends a lot of artists, so they aren't allowed."

    sakana "The current vision of the game is primarily for it to be a large collection of various short, semi unrelated stories that all take place in a fictional dormitory, or “streamer house” "

    sakana "The premise of this setting is primarily inspired by the consensus in the community that having all the girls in one location like this would cause chaos. "

    sakana "The goal of this project is to make the code as lightweight and modular as possible so that almost anyone can add content to the game without having to worry about others "

    sakana "This approach will hopefully side step the largest issue that shuts down community developed visual novels. which is having further development of the story grind to a halt because 1 or 2 people on the dev team aren't keeping up with the rest."

    sakana "With this approach anyone can add content to the game, disconnected from the rest of development. and are shown to the player via the games inbuilt story director."

    sakana "So you can work at your own pace, and then commit your work to the github repository once your mission is fully complete."

    sakana "Or if you decide you aren't a fan of making visual novels and don't want to finish developing whatever it is you are working on, you aren't slowing anyone else down or halting development in any way."

    sakana "The game is currently planned to focus on the streamer house, and what is going on inside it. This is primarily done to minimize the amount of assets needed to be created."

    sakana "If you want to potentially expand the amount of starting areas the game has then you are welcome to."

    sakana "Currently the streamer house has a dozen or so starting areas all inside of the house. primarily bedrooms and common areas."

    sakana "In the future, more floors are planned along with more areas outside of the house such as pools, and hotsprings on the property."

    sakana "These haven't been added yet due to them requiring the creation of additional area specific characters sprites, which would already triple the workload."
